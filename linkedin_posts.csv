Of the 14.5 million children who did not receive a single vaccine in 2023, more than half live in vulnerable settings. For these children, a simple vaccine could change the course of their lives—or save it entirely.But there are bright spots in the data, too. As countries introduce and scale up access to new and under-utilized vaccines, more people are protected from preventable diseases like polio, meningitis, pneumonia, and HPV. Gavi spearheaded many of these introductions, including for the HPV vaccine—which is now protecting twice as many people in Gavi-supported countries as it was in 2022.Of course, more work needs to be done. That’s why partners like Gavi are dedicated to reaching those who’ve been left behind and ensuring that all children have access to life-saving vaccines—no matter where they live."
